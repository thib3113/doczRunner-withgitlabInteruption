This projet is here to run a documentation, generated by [docz](https://docz.site), waiting for webhooks coming from gitlab, when pipeline succeed.

The goal of this image is to auto reload a styleguide, when we push on the gitlab repository .
We have a specific repository for the documentation .

This is divided in two part, the tag CI, will be used in Gitlab CI to test if docz correctly generate the documentation . When it's work, gitlab will send a webhook to the guideline website .

The other part is the website guideline, it will clone the repository in the working folder, symlink the `current` folder to this folder, and start `docz` on this folder . Behind this, we use an express proxy, handling the webhook of gitlab, to update the current folder .
